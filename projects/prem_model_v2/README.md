### Project Overview
1. Use webscraping libraries such as BeautifulSoup and CloudScraper to scrape web data that we will use for our model. 
2. Utilize Python machine learning and data-cleansing libraries such as Scikit-Learn and Pandas to fit a model to our data.
3. Continue to improve on our model by implementing different ML algorithms, scraping more data, and/or engineer more predictive features.
