### Project Overview
The objective of this project is to predict the outcome of a Premier League football (soccer) match given past data. To achieve this, a variety of machine learning and deep learning techniques will be used such as a Random Forest and Neural Networks. 

1. Use webscraping libraries such as BeautifulSoup and CloudScraper to scrape web data that we will use for our model. 
2. Utilize Python machine learning and data-cleansing libraries such as Scikit-Learn and Pandas to fit a model to our data.
3. Continue to improve on our model by implementing different ML algorithms, scraping more data, and/or engineer more predictive features.

### Dependencies
* BeautifulSoup
* Cloudscraper
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
